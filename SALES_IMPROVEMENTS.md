## Changes Made

### 1. Sales Form Dynamic Stock Validation

#### New Features:
- Visual stock indicators in quantity field labels

### 2. Dynamic Alerts System

#### Fixed Issues:
- **Real-time Updates**: Alerts now update immediately after sales/purchases

## Testing Instructions

### Sales Form Testing:
1. Open the sales form (Nouvelle Vente)
2. Select a product - price should auto-fill
3. Try to enter quantity higher than available stock - should show error
4. Quantity field should be limited to available stock
5. Out-of-stock products should disable quantity input
6. Submit should validate stock before processing

### Alerts System Testing:
1. Make a sale that reduces stock below threshold
2. Alerts should update within 15 seconds automatically
3. Making purchases should also update alerts quickly
4. Stock status should be reflected in real-time across the application

### Expected Behavior:
- No more ability to sell more than available stock
- Dynamic pricing based on last purchase price
- Real-time stock alerts that respond immediately to changes
- Better user experience with clear stock information
- Consistent data across all components
